**_We only accept bug reports and pull requests on GitHub._** _To submit a bug report, please **follow these steps:**_

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues).

* If unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, **[open a new one](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new)**.

* The issue report should include:
  * A **title and clear description**
  * As much relevant information as possible and a **code sample demonstrating the issue**
  * An **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring

* Use the relevant bug report templates to compose the issue (latest release / edge):
  * **Template for Active Record** (models, database) issues: [gem](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_gem.rb) / [master](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_master.rb)
  * **Template for Action Pack** (controllers, routing) issues: [gem](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_gem.rb) / [master](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_master.rb)
  * **Generic template** for other issues: [gem](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/generic_gem.rb) / [master](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/generic_master.rb)

* Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**.

* That's it! Sumbit the issue.
